# Personal website

Thanks for checking out my personal website. 
This is my portfolio site, a fun personal project and a good opportunity to display showcase some of the things i've done as a developer.
I built this to learn SvelteKit, ThreeJS and any other technologies i happen to pick up on the way.

## What i used:

#### Framework and Libraries:
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) my current favourite metaframework for building web apps
- [ThreeJs](https://threejs.org/) 3D model rendering for web pages
 
#### Development:
- TypeScript 
- HTML 
- SCSS Svelte's handling of css makes this preferable to Tailwind which was my initial choice for styling
- VSC

#### Design: 
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) Site design
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3d model & animation
- MS Paint Monitor screen texture

#### Hosting:
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) Linux instance 
- [NGinx](https://nginx.org/en/) serving the website
- [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) lets Encrypt SSL certification 


###### Side Notes:
- All pages are pre-rendered and served static. While this can be served easily from a bucket, i have plans that require server side processing
